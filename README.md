# THEY CONTROL YOU

This week's weekly obssession is googly eyes. I like the way they convert anything (for me, at least) into something stupid and hilarious. I go around with at least a few of them in my pockets, ready to stick them to any surface unlucky enough to be in the wrong place (near me) at the wrong time (when I'm near them).

I wanted to stick as many googly eyes as I could inside a canvas and make them follow my mouse around. I got that working but it was missing... something.

I started playing around with colors and I quickly realized this would work way better if they were less goofy and way more creepy.

I wanted to give this whole project a vague aura of creepyness and unease. Imagine this sketch being drawn on a bigger screen! This would really creep me out.
